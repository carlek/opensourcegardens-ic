		<p>At the moment you normally order open source seeds directly from their breeders. To help you find seeds and breeders, there is a service provider called <strong>"Open Source Seeds"</strong>, which acts as an interface to connect breeders and growers. To this end Open Source Seeds maintains a <a href="https://www.opensourceseeds.org/en/die-liste">list of officially licensed open source licensed seeds</a> and their respective suppliers. You can browse the catalogue online and once you have decided on your seed selection, you can order directly from the respective breeder(s).</p>

		<p>The US "Open Source Seeds Initiative" also <a href="https://osseeds.org/seeds/">maintains a list of available open source seeds and their distributors</a> as well as the Latin-American <a href="https://www.bioleft.org/plataforma/">open source seeds community "Bioleft"</a>. However, due to the European "<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R2031">Plant Health Law Regulation (EU) 2016/2031</a>" these organisations are not allowed to send these seeds to Europe.</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="spring-campaign-sharing-our-sources">Spring campaign: <em>"sharing our sources"</em></h2>
		
		<p>In our spring campaign <em>"sharing our sources"</em> we like to help people start growing Open Source Gardens. <strong>We send out "starter kits" with multiple varieties of Open Source Seeds</strong> so you do not need to order them individually from different breeders (although we encourage you to do so in case you like them). In any of these starter kits you find a tasty selection of <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/die-liste">officially licensed Open Source Seeds</a> together with a leaflet offering tips for an easy start. In return we kindly ask you to join our community and connect with us ðŸŒ»</p>

		<p>If you particiate you will receive eight seeds each of Open Source Tomatoes <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/node/207">Vivaroma</a>, <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/node/206">Vivagrande</a> and  <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/node/7">Sunviva</a>, Open Source Corn <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/node/230">Lisanco</a> and Open Source Chili <a href="https://opensourceseeds.org/en/node/252">Black Heart</a>. Also included is a handmade <a href="FIXME:URL">leaflet with more information</a> about Open Source Seeds in general and tip for growing. <strong>All we like you to do in return is to actually grow these seeds</strong>, enjoy your gardening season and your harvest - and to please not leave them unattended somewhere in your shelf and forget about it ...</p>
		
		<p>Of course, you do not need to grow all of them or all by yourself. <strong>Open Source Seeds are free to share with everyone!</strong> And it can be even more fun to share them with your friends and to grow them together or simultaneously.</p>

		<h3 id="about-connecting-gardens">About connecting gardens</h3>
		
		<p>We like to create the #IoG, the "Internet of Gardens" and connect us with our gardens and our gardens with eacht other so we do similar. In a first step you can put your garden on a custom OpenStreetMap. The idea is to see and show how many gardens we are and how we grow together. We currently support three types of gardens: green: public and/or community gardens that anyone is allowed to visit under certain rules like opening times (but not or money). purple: private gardens people invite friends to come or people who like to connetd. blue: just another osg but no one likes to connet.</p> 
		
		<p>Our map is based on OpenStreetMap and <a href="fixme">you can add your garden yourself</a>. We are planning to write a how to, so long you can use <a href="fixme">this email-template</a> and  we put it online for you. </p>

		<p>We have a lot of ideas to grow and offer more ways of connecting people and gardens in the future. There are for example already plans to create an <strong>Internet of Gardens (IoG)</strong> for those of you who like to show their gardens. This includes possibilities to put your garden on a real-world map as well as to create your own digital garden ... stay tuned!</p>
